#BANK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

The Bank Management System is a Java-based desktop application developed using NetBeans (Apache) that simulates the essential operations of a real-world banking system. The project focuses on managing customer accounts and performing basic banking transactions in a structured, secure, and efficient manner.

This application is designed to demonstrate core Java programming, object-oriented principles, and modular application development, making it ideal for academic use, learning purposes, and beginner-level Java projects.

##PROJECT OVERVIEW
In modern banking, automation plays a crucial role in maintaining accuracy, security, and efficiency. This Bank Management System automates routine banking tasks such as account creation, balance management, and transaction handling. The system ensures smooth data flow and minimizes manual errors by following a well-structured Java application architecture.

The project is developed entirely in Java using the NetBeans IDE (Apache), providing a stable development environment and clean project organization.
